## Statistical Question
For the Calculus AB, is there a difference in the average pass rate for females vs males vs nonbinary? 

## Hypothesis
I predict that all genders will have similar pass rates. I think that while there may be less females or nonbinary people who take the tests, all the pass rates will actually be quite comparable. 

While females are underrepresented in the mathematics field, they are equally as competent. 

## Research
I added up all the test results for the Calculus AB test. I calculated sums for each gender and pass/fail result. From there, I was able to calculate the pass rate for each gender. 

## Results
```
For the AP Calculus AB Test
___________________________
Pass/Fail Totals:
Total Males Passing:  77546
Total Males Failing:  49748
Total Females Passing:  76805
Total Females Failing:  49752
Total Anothers Passing:  110
Total Anothers Failing:  76

Pass Rates:
Male Pass Rate:  0.6092
Female Pass Rate:  0.6069
Another Pass Rate:  0.5914
```

## Conclusion
My results show me that the pass rates across gender boundaries is very similar. This shows me equal competence across genders. 

I was also surprised to see that the number of females and males taking the test was very similar. I did not expect this. 

## Further Research
I would like to find out the pass rates across both gender and race. 

Is there a certain identifying race which has the largest disparity across their genders in their pass rates? 

## Silly Bug
My data table started off with a special column header , so I had to skip the first value
